            <p><strong>passage 1 <em>finding fossil man</em></strong></p>
<p>1.We can read of things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘things that …’: defining relative clause to give essential information about someone or something–information that we need in order to understand what or who is being referred to. ‘that’ is the relative pronoun (&#x3D; ‘thing’, so we do not repeat ‘things’) and cannot be omitted because it is the subject of the relative clause (while ‘things’ is the object of the main clause), not object, and followed by a verb (‘happened’). </li>
<li>‘where people …’: non-defining relative clause to give extra information about ‘the Near East’ (it isn’t essential for understanding what we are talking about.) , so we use commas (,) to separate it from the rest of the sentence. ‘where’ is the relative adverb and can be replace by ‘which’ with a preposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘some parts of the world where …’: defining relative clause, ‘where’ is the relative pronoun in informal language.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas–legends handed down from one generation of storytellers to another. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘The only way that …’: defining relative clause, ‘that’ can be left out if it is followed by a subject (‘they’).</li>
</ul>
<p>4.These legends are useful, because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘people who …’: defining relative clause.</li>
<li>‘write down what …’: defining relative clause, ‘what’ &#x3D; ‘the things that’.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘wondered where …’: defining relative clause.</li>
<li>wonder:  to think about something and try to decide what is true, what will happen, what you should do, etc.</li>
<li>‘peoples now living in …’ &#x3D; ‘peoples now who is living in …’. Past participle clause. Participle clauses enable us to say information in a more economical way. They are formed using present participles (going, reading, seeing, walking, etc.), past participles (gone, read, seen, walked, etc.) or perfect participles (having gone, having read, having seen, having walked, etc.). We can use participle clauses when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. Participle clauses do not have a specific tense. The tense is indicated by the verb in the main clause. Participle clauses are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘explain that …’: defining relative clause.</li>
</ul>
<p>7.But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘people who …’: defining relative clause.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first ‘modern men’ came from.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘find out where …’: defining relative clause.</li>
</ul>
<p>9.Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, because this is easier to shape than other kinds. </p>
<ul>
<li>made of: the basic material or qualities of something.</li>
<li>made from: how something is manufactured, ‘Plastic is made from oil.’</li>
<li>made out of: something that has been changed or transformed from one thing into another, ‘candle-holders made out of wine bottles’.</li>
<li>made with: the ingredients of food and drink, ‘sushi always made with raw fish’.</li>
</ul>
<p>10.so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘the men who …’: defining relative clause.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>passage 2 <em>spare that spider</em></strong></p>
<p>1.Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends? </p>
<ul>
<li>wonder: to be very surprised by something.</li>

<li>the human race: [singular] all people, considered together as a group.</li>

<p>3.if it were not for the protection we get from insect-eating animals. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘if it were …’: imagined condition to talk about the possible result of an imagined situation in the present or future that are impossible or unlikely in reality. When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he&#x2F;she form.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects, but all of them put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders. </p>
<ul>
<li>put together: (used after a noun or nouns referring to a group of people or things) combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do the least harm to us and our belongs.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>6.Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘related to them’: relate to something&#x2F;somebody, to be connected with something&#x2F;somebody; to refer to something&#x2F;somebody.</li>
</ul>
<p>7.One can tell the difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘tell the difference’: tell,  [transitive] (not used in the progressive tenses or in the passive) to recognize the difference between one thing or person and another.</li>

<p>9.One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre; that is something like 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football pitch. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘authority on spiders’:  authority (on something) a person with special knowledge.</li>
<li>‘that is …’: ‘that’ &#x3D; ‘he estimated there were more than 2,250,000 in one acre’, relative clauses refer to a whole sentence or a longer stretch of language, always use which to introduce these clauses  in informal speaking to express an opinion or evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>10.It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day. </p>
<ul>
<li>‘make more than the wildest guess’: wild,  having no discipline or control. ‘beyond somebody’s wildest dreams’: far more, better, etc. than you could ever have imagined or hoped for.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>passage 3 <em>matterhorn man</em></strong></p>
<p>1.Modern alpinists try to climb mountains by a route which will give them good sport, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded. </p>
<ul>
<li>sport: [uncountable] (old-fashioned) pleasure or fun.</li>

<p>2.The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, because the summit was the prize they sought, especially if it had never been attained before. </p>
<ul>
<li>attain:  to succeed in getting something, usually after a lot of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most perilous nature, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder at the thought, but they did not go out of their way to court such excitement. </p>

<ul>

<li>impoverished: very poor; without money.</li>

<li>coarse: (of food, wine, etc) of low quality; inferior.</li>

<li>shelter:  [uncountable] protection from rain, danger, or attack.</li>

<p>8.For men accustomed to eating seven-course dinners and sleeping between fine linen sheets at home, the changes to the Alps must have been very hard indeed.</p>

<ul>
<li>sport:   [uncountable] (British English) (North American English sports [plural]) activity that you do for pleasure and that needs physical effort or skill, usually done in a special area and according to fixed rules.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>We use cleft sentences, especially in speaking, to connect what is already understood to what is new to the listener. In a cleft sentence, a single message is divided (cleft) into two clauses. This allows us to focus on the new information. </p>
<p>It-clauses are the most common type of cleft clause. The information that comes after it is emphasised for the listener. The clause which follows the it-clause is connected using that and it contains information that is already understood. We often omit that in informal situations when it is the object of the verb. </p>
<p>When a personal subject is the focus, we can use who instead of that. We often omit who in informal situations when it is the object of the verb. </p>
<p>When a plural subject is the focus, we use a plural verb but It + be remains singular.</p>
<p>We can use negative structures in the it-clause.</p>
<p>Wh-cleft sentences are most often introduced by what, but we can also use why, where, how, etc. The information in the wh-clause is typically old or understood information.</p>
