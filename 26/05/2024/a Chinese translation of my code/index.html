            a Chinese translation of my code

            <p>Sometimes I am confused about what Chinese my code, ‘to increase the happiness of mankind and make a brave new world’, I should translate into. Literally, it can be interpreted word by word as ‘增加人類幸福，建造美麗新世界’. However, it is not of such literary taste. And what I want to convey are more than that.</p>
<p>According to <em>Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary</em> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english"><em>OALD</em></a>), <strong>increase</strong> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to make something greater in amount, number, value, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the literal sense, its Chinese is ‘增加’. But the word in my code means <strong>enhance</strong>, whose explanation in <em>OALD</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to increase or further improve the good quality, value or status of somebody&#x2F;something</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly, it means ‘further enhancing the increasing of something’. Or, we can say ‘增進’ in Chinese.</p>
<p>‘happiness’ here is not just joy (‘快樂’ in Chinese) as in Bach’s melody of <em>Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring</em> or like Bertrand Russel’s <em>The Conquest of Happiness</em>, but <strong>welfare</strong>, which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the general health, happiness and safety of a person, an animal or a group</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means ‘福祉’.</p>
<p>‘mankind’ is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all humans, thought about as one large group; the human race</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely it is ‘人類’ in Chinese, but we have a literary alternative–’蒼生’.</p>
<p>Some may think ‘make a brave new world’ is just like ‘make a cake’. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>to create or prepare something by combining materials or putting parts together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not the case. ‘make’ here means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to cause something to be a success</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or, to be more precise,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to manage to reach or go to a place or position</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably we can say ‘鑄就’, since it requires effort and is not a piece of cake.</p>
<p>‘a brave new world’ refers to Aldous Huxley’s book, as we know. ‘brave’ is not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(of a person) willing to do things that are difficult, dangerous or painful; not afraid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but as part of the phrase ‘brave new’, which means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new in an impressive way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although ‘a brave new world’ is sometimes ironic as <em>OALD</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a situation or society that changes in a way that is meant to improve people’s lives but is often a source of extra problems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is not my intention. I believe it is a different and better one from our present-day world. ‘world’ can be translate into ‘天下’ or ‘世界’ or ‘世間’, but in this phrase, we can perceive it as a whole and interpret it as ‘璀璨新天’, even though ‘璀璨’ in Chinese means ‘bright’ to some extent.</p>
<p>So I think my code may be translated into ‘增進蒼生福祉，鑄就璀璨新天’. I believe, however, there must be a better translation.</p>
